# Advent of Flink 2024
A while ago, I started https://github.com/ververica/flink-sql-cookbook as an advent calendar back at Ververica. This year, I am doing something similar, but a) in the context of Apache Flink(r) for Confluent Cloud and (b) a bit more free more. Essentially, just one bite-sized tip or trick for Flink SQL practitioners every day leading up to Christmas Eve 2024.

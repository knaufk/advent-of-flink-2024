# Advent of Flink 2024
A while ago, when I was stil part of Ververica, me and some colleagues started 
[this Flink SQL cookbook](https://github.com/ververica/flink-sql-cookbook) as an advent calendar. This year, I decided to
do something similar again, but a) in the context of Apache Flink(r) for Confluent Cloud and (b) a bit more free-form. 
Essentially, just one bite-sized tip or trick for Flink SQL practitioners every day leading up to Christmas Eve 2024. 
I originally created them for an Confluent-internal audience, and just sharing them out here for anyone who is 
interested.
